Topic 2: Build a Full Travel Itinerary Planner (e.g., Group Tours) / Virtual Travel Assistant Planning group tours can be a complex task, especially when it involves catering to diverse preferences and unfamiliar destinations. At TBO, we envision a virtual travel assistant that not only simplifies trip planning but also acts as a knowledgeable travel companion. The assistant would offer expert-level destination insights, including must-visit attractions, local customs, transportation options, and dining recommendations that agents or travelers may not already know. Advanced features like drag-and-drop scheduling, real-time collaboration, and integrated booking for hotels, transport, and activities ensure a seamless planning experience. Additionally, tools like budget tracking and personalized suggestions based on the groupâ€™s interests enhance convenience, while destination-specific expertise adds significant value for both agents and travelers. Imagine a GPT for travel or JARVIS for travel that takes the complete pain out of travel planning, booking and on destination support.
